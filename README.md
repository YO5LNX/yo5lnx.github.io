# Lori, YO5LNX

Repository for my personal ham radio web site, written in Romanian. You can either view the [GitHub Pages rendered version](https://yo5lnx.icanhas.net) or directly on [GitHub](index.md).

## Documentation sources

These are a few resources that I used to create my web page using GitHub Pages:

- [The official Quickstart for GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)
- [List of themes supported out-of-the-box](https://pages.github.com/themes/)
- [The "Midnight" theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight) and [how it renders with default configuration](https://pages-themes.github.io/midnight/)
- [Configuring GitHub Pages](http://web.archive.org/web/20190915225829/http://dh.obdurodon.org/jekyll.xhtml): a guide on customizing the Jekyll themes that can be used for styling

However, I'm not fully happy with the current theme, and don't like any of the other default themes better either. I have been looking around for alternatives, and I found a replacement candidate in the [Beautyful Jekyll theme](https://beautifuljekyll.com/examples/). I need to evaluate if running a custom theme is worth the effort at this point though.
